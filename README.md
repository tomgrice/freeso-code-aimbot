# FreeSO Code Aimbot
A simple desktop app to make calling and co-ordinating games of 'Core Business Unit' (commonly known as 'Code') on [FreeSO](https://github.com/riperiperi/FreeSO) (a modern reimplementation of The Sims Online).

The app automatically traverses commonly used 'code charts' which help players to complete rounds in the most efficient way possible.

The project is a self-contained web app built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and packaged for the desktop with [Tauri](https://tauri.studio). CSS styles are provided by [Cirrus](https://www.cirrus-ui.com).

## Usage
1. [Download and run installer package](https://github.com/tomgrice/freeso-code-aimbot/releases/download/beta/FreeSO.Code.Aimbot_0.2.1_x64_en-US.msi), or alternatively download and extract the binary ZIP package to your desired location.
2. Run the application whilst playing FreeSO - the app window will appear 'Always on Top'.
3. During CBU rounds, use the 0-3 buttons corresponding with each guess result to suggest the next logical guess.
4. Keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+[0-2] can be used to select the result button without having to click. This will also copy the next guess to the clipboard so it can be pasted directly into the game chat.
5. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+R resets the app for a new round.

## Contributing
